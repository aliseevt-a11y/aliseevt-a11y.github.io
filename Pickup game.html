        You are Vlados, an ordinary guy whose trusty, shabby, but indestructible red pickup truck is the last hope for salvation in Russia gone mad. Zombies? Mutants? No! Morons who can't park!</p>

<p>What awaits you in this demo:

(Not)Open world... sort of: Explore a (very) limited area of ​​the map, full of crooked roads.
Driving in the style of "nothing will break if you wrap it with blue tape": Control your red pickup, which is physically affected by every bump and speck of dirt that flies into the hood.
Weapons? We have... something: Fight hordes of morons with the help of a tank turret and your unshakable faith in a beer dream. (Ammo? Endless!)
A plot that feels like it was scribbled on a bar napkin: (there is none)Uncover (or not) the mystery of why everything went wrong and find a way to survive... at least until the next day.
Graphics that will make you remember 1995: Enjoy (or suffer) from 2D graphics, low-res textures and bugs you never even knew about!
Bugs, bugs, and more bugs: This is a demo, remember? Expect crashes, texture drops and cars dancing in the air. We are not responsible for your broken nerves.</p>
<p>This game is for you if:

You like trash and madness.
You are not afraid of bugs.
You are ready to forgive the graphics of the “kindergarten” level.
You have always dreamed of destroying morons in your rusty red pickup.
  Download now! (Risk your sanity!)</p>

<p>Warning: This game may make you laugh, cry, rage, and want to forget you ever played it. Enjoy! (Or don't).
